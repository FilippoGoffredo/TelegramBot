# TelegramBot
@GalaxyExpress999_Bot


This bot automatically sends messages to your telegram group, public channell of private chat. Please, before you run the program make sure to insert the ID of the chat you want
to sends messages to. Also make sure to insert the path of the icon (must be a .ico file). With the small interface you can insert the amount of minutes you want to wait before
the messages are sent and you can also delay the time between the messages (make sure you insert a valid number in both fields). 

P.S. the code is NOT optimized and was made in one day so do NOT expect any error handling.
